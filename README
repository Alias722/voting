This is the project that I use to easily count tickets
And let others see how many votes that their favorites got immediately

using node.js as the main programming language
I think it is easier to begin with

I put this project to Github.com
Hope that anyone sees a bug in the project can report
and help fixing it


If you want to use this system
First, you will have to change the first websiteURL in app.js
Second, the post section in http template you need to change either
