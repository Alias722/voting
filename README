這個程式是我拿來當作台南一中選舉委員會的驗證系統
然後希望可以順便建立開票系統，讓開票過程變得更加刺激

採用 node.js 作為主要的開發語言
因為我覺得它看起來比較簡單

如何使用？
我會把連結放在這裡：

然後你會發現裡面沒有東西只有標題
因為我還沒有時間打嘛

This program is built to run the voting verification system in my high school TNFSH
And I hope I can maybe add invoicing function later on

Using node.js as the default operating language
Because I think it looks way easier and more understandable

Well, how to use this project
I will put the link below:

However, you might think the link direct to nothing but a title
oh, that is probably I still don't have time dealing with it
